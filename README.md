# GO:Touch5

This is a simplified fork of Waldt work on [GoPlus](https://github.com/waldt/goplus).
I have remove the Python parts for now, i have juste worked on the TouchOSC parts.

## Whats different between this and GoPlus ?

The 2 OSC templates has been updated with :
- Full liste of Go:keys 3 / 5 tones [full list](GO5-sounds.md)
- Channel adaptation (GoKeys 3 and 5 listen on channel 4, not 1 like the first Go:Keys)


 
## What's next ?

- Add a Favorite section on the TouchOSC view
- Add loop control on TouchOSC
